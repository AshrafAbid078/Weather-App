# Weather App

Hey there!   
This is a simple and clean weather app I built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It uses the **Weatherbit API** to show real-time weather info based on the city you search for.

## What It Can Do

- Search weather by city name
- Shows current temperature in Celsius
- Displays humidity and wind speed
- Updates weather icon based on current condition (sun, cloud, rain, etc.)
- Handles errors if you enter a wrong city name
- Nice gradient UI that works well on desktop and mobile

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox and gradients)
- JavaScript (ES6+, Fetch API, async/await)
- Weatherbit API
